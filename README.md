***How to Play***
Bugger Game ---This project, titled "Bugger Game", is a Front End Development project that challenges the participant to select a player character, and have player character reach the water without colliding without any bugs.  

To select a player character, utilize the <left arrow>, <right arrow>, and <enter> keys to select the preferred player character.

The player character can be moved to the water by using the <left arrow>, <right arrow>, <up arrow>, and <down arrow> keys.  If there is a collision with a bug, the player character will lose a life and re-spawn if there are lives left.
